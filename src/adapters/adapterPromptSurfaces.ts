 * One slash-prompt surface contributed by a review adapter.
 *
 * Prompt names follow action-first naming: `<action>-<protocolSlug>`
 * (for example `swap-deep`). Users reach for the verb before the venue, so
 * action-first keeps autocomplete grouped by what the user wants to do. When
 * an action has exactly one registered protocol, the bare action name (for
 * example `swap`) is also registered as a shorthand.
 *
 * The surface carries only protocol-specific copy. Boundary language (no
 * signing data, no transaction bytes, local-review-only signing) is owned by
 * the platform and appended at registration time; adapters cannot weaken it.
