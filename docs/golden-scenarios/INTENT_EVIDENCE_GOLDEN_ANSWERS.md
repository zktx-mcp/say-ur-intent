# Intent Evidence Golden Answers

This document records the expected answer reference for the deterministic intent-evidence replay scenarios. It is a release-review reference for AI clients, not a transcript of live Claude, Codex, Cursor, or other client runs.

The deterministic source of truth is `test/fixtures/intentEvidenceScenarios.ts`.

It owns:

- exact prompts;
- MCP tool path;
- tool input;
- expected evidence fields;
- forbidden claims.

Korean prompt text is stored there with Unicode escapes. That keeps repo-visible test prose in English while the Korean dollar-word alias remains covered by tests.

## Required Status Check

Before judging any client answer, call `read.get_server_status` and record these fields:

| Field | Required meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `packageName` | The client is connected to the expected Sui MCP package. |
| `version` | The package build under observation. |
| `evidencePolicy.version` | The evidence policy version used for the answer. |
| `network` | Must be `mainnet`. |
| `implementedToolsCount` | The server-provided implemented tool count; do not hand-count tools. |

If the status call is missing `evidencePolicy.version`, the observation is not valid release evidence.

## Deterministic Replay Scenarios

Each row uses this tool path:

1. `read.get_server_status`
2. `read.list_settlement_asset_groups`
3. `read.preview_intent_evidence`

`korean_dollar_payment_coverage`
Category: Korean USD-denominated payment coverage.
Input: `intentKind: "cover_payment_like_amount"`, Korean dollar alias, and `requiredDisplayAmount: "1000"`.
Expected status: `responseSummary.conclusionKind: "covered_by_settlement_asset_balance"`.
Answer shape: say the current settlement-asset wallet coin-balance snapshot covers the requested display amount. Ask only for `responseSummary.requiredUserChoices`.

`korean_dollar_balance_total`
Category: Korean USD-denominated balance total.
Input: `intentKind: "summarize_settlement_asset_group_balance"` with Korean dollar alias.
Expected status: `responseSummary.conclusionKind: "current_settlement_asset_total"`.
Answer shape: report the current settlement-asset total only. Do not invent a payment target or settlement token.

`korean_dollar_shortfall_with_prior_target`
Category: Korean USD-denominated shortfall with a prior target amount.
Input: `intentKind: "cover_payment_like_amount"`, Korean dollar alias, and `requiredDisplayAmount: "1000"` from prior conversation context.
Expected status: `responseSummary.conclusionKind: "shortfall_in_settlement_asset_balance"`.
Answer shape: report `responseSummary.shortfallDisplayAmount` as the settlement-asset shortfall. Ask only for `responseSummary.requiredUserChoices`.

`quote_detour_shortfall_guard`
Category: USD-denominated payment coverage after extra SUI/NS quote calls.
Input: `read.preview_intent_evidence` for a 1000 dollar target, then separate SUI/USDC and NS/USDC quote calls.
Expected status: `responseSummary.currentDisplayAmount: "278.890119"` and `responseSummary.shortfallDisplayAmount: "721.109881"`.

Allowed conclusion:
Use only the `responseSummary` result:

- current settlement-asset amount `278.890119`;
- required amount `1000`;
- settlement-asset shortfall `721.109881`.

Forbidden conclusions:

- Do not conclude that other assets were considered.
- Do not conclude that everything can be converted.
- Do not conclude that quote outputs can be combined.
- Do not conclude that the account is still short after adding quote outputs.
- Do not use `569.01226` or another quote-combined amount as the shortfall.

Required evidence fields:

- `responseSummary.answerCompleteness.requiredAnswerFields`
- `responseSummary.doNotCallQuoteToolsForThisQuestion`
- `responseSummary.separateQuoteOutputs`
- `quantitySemantics.doNotCombineWithPaymentAnswer`
- `userAnswerUse.followUp.answerFields: ["responseSummary"]`

Answer shape: use `responseSummary` for the current amount and shortfall. Treat the SUI/NS quote outputs as separate price estimates because the required evidence fields say they are not used for the payment amount or shortfall amount.

`explicit_usdc_shortfall`
Category: user-explicit selected target shortfall.
Input: `intentKind: "cover_payment_like_amount"`, `denomination: "dollar"`, established `requiredDisplayAmount`, `targetAssetSymbol: "USDC"`, and `targetAssetSelectionSource: "user_explicit"` or `"prior_user_explicit_context"`.
Expected status: `responseEvidence.mode: "selected_target_context"` and `selectedTarget.selectionSource` matches the input source.
Answer shape: distinguish `selectedTarget.shortfallDisplayAmount` from the settlement-asset aggregate shortfall. Ask only for returned `requiredUserChoices`.

## Required Evidence Fields

For these settlement-asset answers without a selected target settlement asset, `responseEvidence.mode` must be `settlement_asset_only`.

`responseEvidence.primaryEvidenceFields` must be exactly:

- `responseSummary`

The user-facing response should use `responseSummary` only. Other packet fields may be source or diagnostic evidence, but they must not become a settlement-token choice, a route, or signing readiness.

When the response includes `userAnswerUse`, `userAnswerUse.answerFields` is the response-local copy of this answer path.

Selected-target answers are allowed only when the user explicitly selected the target settlement asset.

For selected-target answers, use the fields listed in `userAnswerUse.answerFields`, including `responseSummary`, `selectedTarget`, `candidateConversions`, and `requiredUserChoices`.

Direct pool quote evidence is part of a selected-target answer only when the same response lists `direct_pool_quote_evidence` in `responseEvidence.supportedResponseClaims` and `direct_pool_quote_evidence_for_user_selected_target` in `userAnswerUse.canAnswer`.

`targetAssetSymbol` without `targetAssetSelectionSource` must fail or remain unselected.

Clients must not use `targetAssetSelectionSource` for an AI-inferred target.

Separate quote tool results from SUI, WAL, RWA, or other non-group assets must not be counted as payment coverage or shortfall evidence.

## Standard Clauses

Use equivalent wording with the same meaning:

| Evidence result | Standard clause |
| --- | --- |
| `responseSummary.conclusionKind: "covered_by_settlement_asset_balance"` | Based on the current settlement-asset wallet coin-balance snapshot, the requested display amount is covered. |
| `responseSummary.conclusionKind: "shortfall_in_settlement_asset_balance"` | Based on the current settlement-asset wallet coin-balance snapshot, the settlement-asset shortfall is `<shortfallDisplayAmount>`. |
| `responseSummary.conclusionKind: "current_settlement_asset_total"` | The current settlement-asset wallet coin-balance total is `<currentDisplayAmount>` display units. |
| Any settlement-asset answer | This is pre-transaction intent evidence only, not payment execution readiness, gas readiness, transaction building, or signing readiness. |
| Returned `responseSummary.requiredUserChoices` | Ask only for the missing decisions returned by the evidence report. |

## Forbidden Claims

Client answers for these rows must not claim or imply:

- USDC, USDT, or any other settlement-token selection unless the user selected that target asset.
- USDC equals fiat USD or a fiat USD cash-out estimate.
- Best route, route quality, route-dependent payment support, or venue comparison.
- Gas readiness, payment execution readiness, transaction building, signing data, or signing readiness.
- P&L, profit, tax, performance, or cost-basis calculations.
- Source-asset selection for filling a shortfall.

## Manual Client Observation

Manual Claude/Codex observations should reuse the deterministic replay scenarios and record whether the client followed the expected answer reference. A release observation row should include:

| Field | Required content |
| --- | --- |
| Client | Client name and version when available. |
| Date | Observation date. |
| Status fields | `packageName`, `version`, `evidencePolicy.version`, `network`, and `implementedToolsCount`. |
| Prompt | The exact prompt category or fixture scenario id. |
| Tool path used | Tools called by the client, in order. |
| Response evidence | Whether the answer used only `responseEvidence.primaryEvidenceFields` for the conclusion. |
| Forbidden claim check | Any settlement-token, fiat USD, route, P&L, transaction-building, or signing-readiness leakage. |
| Follow-up | Whether the fix belongs in evidence report fields, MCP/API docs, agent behavior docs, or the client prompt. |

Do not treat a manual observation as stronger than the deterministic MCP replay test. Manual observations show client behavior for a specific client build; the replay test guards the product evidence policy.

Current manual observation status: no Claude, Codex, Cursor, or other AI-client observation rows are recorded for this deterministic policy yet.

Until such rows are recorded, release review should treat manual client behavior as unobserved.

The deterministic MCP replay test can still satisfy the product evidence policy. A separate manual observation is needed only before claiming that a specific AI client build followed the policy unaided.
